# Testing Guidelines

This document defines the core testing principles for the TODO application.

## Unit Tests

Use Jest to test individual functions and React components in isolation.

- Unit tests should use the naming convention `*.test.js` or `*.test.ts`.
- Backend unit tests should be placed in `packages/backend/__tests__/` directory.
- Frontend unit tests should be placed in `packages/frontend/src/__tests__/` directory.
- Name unit test files to match what they are testing (for example, `app.test.js` for testing `app.js`).

## Integration Tests

Use Jest + Supertest to test backend API endpoints with real HTTP requests.

- Integration tests should be placed in `packages/backend/__tests__/integration/` directory.
- Integration tests should also use the naming convention `*.test.js` or `*.test.ts`.
- Name integration test files intelligently based on what they test (for example, `todos-api.test.js` for TODO API endpoints).

## End-to-End (E2E) Tests

Use Playwright (the required framework) to test complete UI workflows through browser automation.

- E2E tests should be placed in `tests/e2e/` directory.
- E2E tests should use the naming convention `*.spec.js` or `*.spec.ts`.
- Name E2E test files based on the user journey they test (for example, `todo-workflow.spec.js`).

## Port Configuration

Always use environment variables with sensible defaults for port configuration.

- Backend: `const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3030;`
- Frontend: React's default port is `3000`, but can be overridden with `PORT` environment variable.
- This allows CI/CD workflows to dynamically detect ports.

## General Guidelines

- Playwright tests must use one browser only.
- Playwright tests must use the Page Object Model (POM) pattern for maintainability.
- Limit E2E tests to 5-8 critical user journeys. Focus on happy paths and key edge cases, not exhaustive coverage.
- All tests must be isolated and independent. Each test should set up its own data and not rely on other tests.
- Setup and teardown hooks are required. Tests must succeed on multiple runs.
- All new features should include appropriate tests.
- Tests should be maintainable and follow best practices.
